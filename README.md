# Python---RESTful-API

#### This is a project that I created for my Python programming class in the first semester of second year (2021). The brief was to use the OMDB API to create a program which sorted through the IMDB movie database to return information of the user's choosing. Movies or series can be found by searching the title through different parameters set by the user. The project's aim was to introduce RESTful API and how it is used with Python. I achieved the second highest mark in the class, obtaining 92% for this project. It includes the project code, issues I found while programming and a report on the use of API in the program.
